# Awesome Invoicing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of invoicing and e-invoicing tools for freelancers and small businesses — with a focus on **free**, **standards-compliant**, and **AI-native** options.

Sending an invoice sounds simple until you factor in tax rules, formatting standards, and the growing number of countries that now mandate structured **e-invoicing** (EN 16931, XRechnung, ZUGFeRD, Peppol BIS, Factur-X). This list collects the tools worth knowing — from no-signup PDF generators to compliance networks to the new wave of AI-native invoicing that runs inside assistants like Claude and ChatGPT.

Everything here is a real, usable tool that a solo freelancer or a small business could adopt today. Enterprise-only compliance platforms are listed separately for reference.

## How to choose an invoicing tool

Most invoicing tools are variations on four questions. Decide which of these matter to you before picking, because very few tools do all four well:

- **Is it free — actually free, forever?** Many "free" tools cap you at 3 clients or 5 invoices a month, then require an upgrade. A true free-forever tool has no such wall.
- **Is it standards-compliant?** If you invoice public-sector or business customers in the EU, you increasingly *must* send a structured e-invoice conforming to **EN 16931** — in Germany that means **XRechnung** or **ZUGFeRD**; across the EU, **Peppol BIS**; in France, **Factur-X**. A pretty PDF is not the same as a compliant e-invoice. (No such mandate exists for US domestic invoicing.)
- **Is it AI-native?** A new category of tools lets you create an invoice by *asking* — through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, an assistant skill, a CLI, or a chat interface — instead of filling out a web form. Distinct from tools that merely bolt an "AI assistant" onto a traditional app.
- **Can you start without signing up?** No-signup tools let you produce an invoice in seconds; account-based tools trade that friction for saved clients, history, and payment tracking.

Tools below are tagged so you can scan for the combination you need.
